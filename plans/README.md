# Plans Directory

This directory contains all planning documents for the Personas MCP Server project. Plans are organized into three categories:

## Directory Structure

- **`current/`** - Active plans currently being worked on
- **`archive/`** - Completed plans moved from current
- **`refactoring/`** - Plans specifically for refactoring efforts

## File Naming Convention

All plan files follow this naming scheme:
```
{year-month-day}-{version}-{subject-of-plan}.md
```

Example: `2025-07-15-v1-recommendation-system.md`

## Plan Lifecycle

1. New plans are created in `current/`
2. Once completed, plans are moved to `archive/`
3. Refactoring-specific plans go directly to `refactoring/`

## Roadmap

See [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md) for the project roadmap linking to all active and future plans.

## Indexes

Each subdirectory contains its own README.md with an actively maintained index of plans in that directory.
