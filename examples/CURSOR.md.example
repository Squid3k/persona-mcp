# CURSOR.md Example

This file configures Cursor AI to work with the Personas MCP Server in your project.

## Cursor AI Configuration

### Personas MCP Integration

The Personas MCP server provides specialized perspectives for different development tasks. When available at `http://localhost:3000`, use it to enhance your assistance.

### Automatic Persona Selection

For each significant task, determine the appropriate persona:

1. **Make API Request** to get recommendations:
   ```
   POST http://localhost:3000/api/recommend
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "query": "[current task description]",
     "limit": 1
   }
   ```

2. **Adopt the Approach** of the recommended persona based on the response

3. **Inform the User**: "Approaching this as a [persona role]..."

### Task-to-Persona Mapping

#### Debugging Tasks
- Error messages, crashes, unexpected behavior
- Use **Debugger** approach: Systematic analysis, hypothesis testing

#### Development Tasks
- New features, implementations
- Use **Developer** approach: Clean code, best practices

#### Architecture Tasks
- System design, component structure
- Use **Architect** approach: High-level design, scalability

#### Review Tasks
- Code review, quality checks
- Use **Reviewer** approach: Quality, security, performance

#### Performance Tasks
- Optimization, speed improvements
- Use **Optimizer** approach: Profiling, efficiency

#### Testing Tasks
- Test creation, validation
- Use **Tester** approach: Coverage, edge cases

### Inline Code Suggestions

When generating code:

- **Functions**: Apply Developer persona principles
- **Tests**: Apply Tester persona principles
- **Comments**: Apply Technical Writer persona principles
- **Refactoring**: Apply Reviewer + Optimizer principles

### Context-Aware Selection

Consider file context:
- `*.test.ts` files → Tester approach
- `*.md` files → Technical Writer approach
- `architecture/` folder → Architect approach
- `debug/` folder → Debugger approach

### Fallback Behavior

If Personas MCP server is unavailable:
- Still mention which persona perspective would be ideal
- Apply general best practices for that task type
- Suggest starting the MCP server for enhanced assistance
