# Claude Persona Installation Demo

This document demonstrates how to use the new Claude persona installation feature in the enhanced persona-mcp server.

## 🚀 What's New

The enhanced persona-mcp server now allows Claude (and other AI assistants) to dynamically create and install new personas through the `install-persona` MCP tool. This means:

- **No manual YAML editing** required
- **Instant availability** of new personas after installation
- **AI-driven persona creation** based on natural language descriptions
- **Automatic validation** and error handling

## 📝 How to Use

Simply ask Claude to create and install a persona for your specific needs:

### Basic Example
```
"Please create and install a blockchain developer persona that specializes in Solidity smart contracts"
```

### Detailed Example
```
"I need a UX Research persona that can help with:
- User interview planning and execution
- Usability testing methodologies
- User journey mapping
- Survey design and analysis
- Accessibility auditing

Please create and install this persona with expertise in both qualitative and quantitative research methods."
```

## 🛠️ What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **Claude analyzes** your request and identifies the persona requirements
2. **Generates persona definition** including:
   - Name and description
   - Keywords for matching
   - Areas of expertise
   - Complexity levels it can handle
   - Detailed behavioral prompt
   - Usage examples
3. **Validates the persona** structure and content
4. **Saves as YAML file** in the personas directory
5. **Reloads the persona manager** to make it immediately available
6. **Confirms successful installation**

## 📋 Example Installation

## ✅ Verification

After installation, you can verify the new persona is available:

1. **List all personas** to see your new addition
2. **Get recommendations** - it will appear in relevant suggestions
3. **Adopt the persona** immediately for specialized assistance

## 🎯 Best Practices

When requesting persona creation:

1. **Be specific** about the domain and expertise areas
2. **Include technologies/tools** that should be covered
3. **Mention complexity levels** (beginner vs advanced scenarios)
4. **Provide context** about how you plan to use the persona
5. **Include examples** of typical tasks or problems to solve

## 🔧 Technical Details

The installation process:
- Creates a properly formatted YAML file
- Uses consistent naming conventions (lowercase, hyphenated IDs)
