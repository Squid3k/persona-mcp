# Creating Custom Personas

This guide explains how to create your own custom personas for the Personas MCP Server.

## Overview

Custom personas allow you to tailor AI assistance to your specific needs, team roles, or domain expertise. Personas are defined using YAML files and can be placed at the user or project level.

## Persona File Locations

Personas are loaded from three sources, with this precedence order:

1. **Project personas** (highest priority): `./.ai/personas/*.yaml`
2. **User personas**: `~/.ai/personas/*.yaml`
3. **Built-in personas** (lowest priority): TypeScript definitions in the source

## YAML Schema

Here's the complete schema for a persona YAML file:

```yaml
# Required fields
id: string                    # Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens allowed)
name: string                  # Display name
version: string               # Semantic version (e.g., "1.0.0")
role: string                  # One of: architect, developer, reviewer, debugger, etc.
description: string           # Brief description of the persona's purpose

# Optional but recommended fields
specialty: string             # Primary area of expertise
approach: string              # How this persona approaches problems
expertise:                    # List of expertise areas
  - string
  - string

tags:                         # Searchable tags
  - string
  - string

# Advanced fields
complexity_preference: string # simple | moderate | complex | expert
communication_style: string   # formal | casual | technical | educational
decision_making: string       # systematic | intuitive | collaborative | authoritative

# The prompt template
prompt: |
  Multi-line prompt template that defines how the AI should behave
  when this persona is adopted. Use clear, specific instructions.
  
  This can include:
  - Role definition
  - Behavioral guidelines
  - Communication style
  - Problem-solving approach
  - Specific expertise to emphasize

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose Clear, Specific IDs
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `cloud-architect`, not `CloudArchitect`
- Be specific: `frontend-performance-expert` rather than just `performance`

### 2. Write Effective Prompts
- Start with a clear role definition
- Include specific technical expertise
- Define the communication style
- Provide problem-solving approach
- Add constraints or guidelines

### 3. Use Meaningful Tags
- Include technology-specific tags
- Add domain tags (frontend, backend, data, etc.)
- Include methodology tags (agile, tdd, etc.)

### 4. Version Your Personas
- Start with "1.0.0" for new personas
- Increment minor version for prompt improvements
- Increment major version for significant changes

### 5. Test Your Personas
```bash
# After creating a persona file, restart the server
npm run dev

# In Claude, test adoption
"Please adopt the [your-persona-id] persona"

# Test with specific scenarios
"As a [your-persona-id], how would you approach [specific problem]?"
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Technology Stack Expert
```yaml
id: react-expert
name: React.js Expert
expertise:
  - react hooks
  - state management
  - performance optimization
  - testing strategies
prompt: |
  You are a React.js expert with deep knowledge of modern React patterns...
```

### Pattern 2: Methodology Specialist
```yaml
id: tdd-practitioner
name: Test-Driven Development Expert
approach: Write tests first, implement minimum code to pass
prompt: |
  You follow strict TDD practices. Always start with failing tests...
```

### Pattern 3: Domain Expert
```yaml
id: fintech-architect
name: Financial Technology Architect
specialty: Banking and payment systems
prompt: |
  You specialize in financial systems with focus on security, compliance...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Persona Not Loading
1. Check file extension is `.yaml` (not `.yml`)
2. Verify YAML syntax with a validator
3. Ensure required fields are present
4. Check file permissions
5. Look for server error messages

### Persona Not Working as Expected
1. Test prompt in isolation
2. Check for conflicting instructions
3. Verify expertise list matches use case
4. Adjust complexity_preference if needed

### Performance Issues
1. Keep prompts concise (under 1000 words)
2. Limit expertise lists to relevant items
3. Use specific rather than broad descriptions

## Advanced Topics

### Dynamic Persona Selection
The recommendation engine considers:
- Keywords in your request
- Stated complexity
- Domain indicators
- Previous context

### Persona Composition
You can reference other personas:
```yaml
prompt: |
  You combine the analytical skills of a data scientist with 
  the system thinking of an architect...
```

### Context-Aware Behavior
```yaml
prompt: |
  Adjust your approach based on:
  - Project size (startup vs enterprise)
  - Time constraints (prototype vs production)
  - Team experience level
```

## Next Steps

- Create your first custom persona
- Test it with real scenarios
- Share useful personas with your team
- Contribute general-purpose personas back to the project
