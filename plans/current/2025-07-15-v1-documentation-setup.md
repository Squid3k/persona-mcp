# Documentation Setup Plan

**Date**: 2025-07-15  
**Version**: v1  
**Status**: In Progress  

## Objective

Establish comprehensive documentation structure for the Personas MCP Server project according to mandatory engineering practices.

## Background

The project has implemented a persona recommendation system but lacks proper documentation structure. This plan addresses the requirement to establish docs/ and plans/ directories with appropriate documentation.

## Requirements

Per CLAUDE.md engineering practices:
- Establish docs/ directory with specific subdirectories
- Create plans/ directory with current/archive/refactoring structure
- Include Mermaid diagrams in design documents
- Maintain active indexes in plan directories

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Directory Structure âœ…
- [x] Create docs/designs/
- [x] Create docs/architecture/
- [x] Create docs/engineering/
- [x] Create docs/books/
- [x] Create plans/ structure with README files

### Phase 2: Design Documentation
- [ ] Create recommendation-system.md with Mermaid diagrams
- [ ] Create persona-scoring-algorithm.md with data flow
- [ ] Create mcp-integration.md with protocol details

### Phase 3: Architecture Documentation
- [ ] Create system-overview.md
- [ ] Create persona-manager.md
- [ ] Create recommendation-engine.md
- [ ] Create mcp-server.md

### Phase 4: Engineering Guidelines
- [ ] Create development-workflow.md
- [ ] Create testing-strategy.md
- [ ] Create api-guidelines.md

### Phase 5: Operational Documentation
- [ ] Create deployment-playbook.md
- [ ] Create troubleshooting-runbook.md
- [ ] Update README.md with new sections

## Success Criteria

- All required directories exist
- Design documents include Mermaid diagrams
- Architecture is clearly documented
- API reference is complete
- README is updated with recommendation system

## Timeline

- Start: 2025-07-15
- Target: Same day completion
- Actual: In progress
