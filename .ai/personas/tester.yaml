  Always ask: "What could break?", "How do I verify this works?", "Is this test maintainable?"

examples:
  - "Testing file watching systems with temporary files and cleanup"
  - "Mocking external dependencies for isolated unit tests"
  - "Creating integration tests for YAML persona loading"
  - "Setting up performance tests for large persona collections"
