# Security Improvements Plan

## Overview

This plan addresses critical security vulnerabilities identified in the security audit conducted on 2025-07-20. The improvements are prioritized based on risk level and implementation complexity.

## Security Audit Findings

### Critical Issues
1. **No HTTPS/TLS Support** - All communications in plaintext
2. **Overly Permissive CORS** - Default allows all origins with credentials
3. **Path Traversal Vulnerability** - No validation on file paths when loading personas

### High-Risk Issues
1. **Missing Authentication** - All endpoints publicly accessible
2. **Unsafe JSON Parsing** - Environment variable parsing could crash server
3. **Unrestricted File Operations** - No limits on file size or count

### Medium/Low Risk Issues
1. **Information Disclosure** - Stack traces exposed in error responses
2. **Limited Rate Limiting** - MCP endpoints not covered
3. **Content Injection** - Persona content not sanitized

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Security Fixes (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Configurable HTTPS Support
- Add HTTPS configuration options to ServerConfig
- Support both HTTP and HTTPS modes
- Provide certificate configuration options
- Default to HTTPS in production environments
- Maintain HTTP support for development

#### 1.2 CORS Security Fix
- Replace wildcard origin with configurable allowed origins
- Implement proper origin validation
- Prevent credentials with wildcard origins
- Add environment-specific CORS defaults

#### 1.3 Path Traversal Protection
- Implement path normalization and validation
- Restrict file access to designated persona directories
- Add path sanitization utilities
- Validate all file operations stay within allowed boundaries

#### 1.4 Safe JSON Parsing
- Wrap all JSON.parse calls in try-catch blocks
- Provide meaningful error messages for invalid JSON
- Add JSON validation for environment variables

### Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization (Week 2-3)

#### 2.1 API Key Authentication
- Implement API key generation and validation
- Add authentication middleware
- Secure sensitive endpoints
- Provide key management utilities

#### 2.2 File Operation Limits
- Implement file size limits (1MB default)
- Add maximum file count per directory (100 default)
- Add resource monitoring
- Implement graceful degradation

### Phase 3: Additional Security Hardening (Month 1-2)

#### 3.1 Error Message Sanitization
- Implement production/development error modes
- Remove stack traces from production errors
- Add error logging for debugging
- Maintain user-friendly error messages

#### 3.2 Comprehensive Rate Limiting
- Extend rate limiting to MCP endpoints
- Add configurable rate limit rules
- Implement IP-based and API key-based limits
- Add rate limit monitoring

#### 3.3 Content Security
- Add content sanitization for persona data
- Implement input validation for all user inputs
- Add output encoding where necessary
- Prevent XSS and injection attacks

## Success Criteria

- All critical vulnerabilities patched
- Security test suite passing
- Documentation updated with security guidelines
- No regression in functionality
- Performance impact < 5%

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for all security utilities
2. Integration tests for authentication flow
3. Security-specific test scenarios
4. Performance benchmarks
5. Manual penetration testing

## Rollout Plan

1. Development environment testing
2. Staging deployment with security monitoring
3. Gradual production rollout
4. Security monitoring and alerting
5. Post-deployment security audit

## Notes

- Backward compatibility will be maintained where possible
- Breaking changes will be clearly documented
- Security defaults will favor safety over convenience
- All security features will be configurable
